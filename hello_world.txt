adding full stack to my skillset will prove advantageous.
it will give me the technical ability to build what comes to mind.
combining my full stack knowledge with my business background will allow me to execute on opportunities.
my business acumen will provide me with opportunities, and my full stack knowledge will allow me to execute solutions for those opportunities.

once my skills are sharpened, i would like to learn ux/ui design in detail.
i will be able to offer freelance solutions to business around the globe.
"I will redesign and build your site" blase blah. 
just pay me!

thank you to whoever created Odin, as you are providing me with the opporunity of a lifetime.
I will not let you down!
